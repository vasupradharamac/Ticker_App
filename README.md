Kryptomania is a Ticker application that shows the current market value of coins with the percentage variation.

The coins are collectively arranged in such a way that the users can identify trending coins, the ones that are ideal for new investors and the non-trending coins.

This application gets data from [nomics](https://nomics.com/) (A cryptocurrency and bitcoin API).

The icons are colleted using "react-ions".

Kryptomania can be cloned using "git clone https://github.com/vasupradharamachanrdan/Ticker_App.git" command into a new repository.

Make sure to delete the "package-lock.json" first and then use the command, "npm update" to update the changes locally on your PC.

Then finally, run "npm start" command to start the development server.
