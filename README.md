## Procedure to clone and run the application:

Kryptomania is a Ticker application that shows the current market value of coins with the percentage variation.

The coins are collectively arranged in such a way that the users can identify trending coins, the ones that are ideal for new investors and the non-trending coins.

This application gets data from [nomics](https://nomics.com/) (A cryptocurrency and bitcoin API).

The icons are colleted using "react-ions".

Kryptomania can be cloned using "git clone https://github.com/vasupradharamachanrdan/Ticker_App.git" command into a new folder.

Make sure to delete the "package-lock.json" first and then use the command, "npm update" to update the changes locally on your PC.

Then finally, run "npm start" command to start the development server.

## App deployment:

The app can be deployed on Netlify or heroku. As of the moment, the app hasn't been deployed at the moment.

But if the app has to be deployed, make sure to use Chrome or Firefox extensions to allow CORS access. Enabling these extensions will allow the app to get and display the contents from the API
.

## Possible upcoming updates to the application:

Additional features like search bar and user login will be implemented soon.

The list of coins displayed can also be changed if and when it is required.
